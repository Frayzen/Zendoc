## The 4 Temperament Families (Keirsey Model)
The Keirsey model groups the 16 MBTI types into **4 major temperament families**, based on their S/N and T/F preferences:
- **Guardians (SJ)**: ISTJ, ISFJ, ESTJ, ESFJ
    
    → Responsible, reliable, organized.
    
    Focused on duty, stability, and tradition. Prefer structure, planning, and following rules.
    
- **Artisans (SP)**: ISTP, ISFP, ESTP, ESFP
    
    → Spontaneous, practical, adaptable.
    
    Live in the moment, seek direct experiences. Flexible and action-oriented.
    
- **Idealists (NF)**: INFJ, INFP, ENFJ, ENFP
    
    → Empathetic, introspective, values-driven.
    
    Visionary and expressive, motivated by personal and interpersonal growth.
    
- **Rationals (NT)**: INTJ, INTP, ENTJ, ENTP
    
    → Logical, strategic, independent thinkers.
    
    Pursue competence, innovation, and systemic understanding. Idea- and theory-oriented.
    
Note: These temperaments provide a helpful lens to understand core motivations and cognitive styles across MBTI types.
## The Dynamic Model
The MBTI is not limited to four static dimensions. It includes a dynamic model that explores dominant, auxiliary, tertiary, and inferior cognitive functions. These functions influence how we interact with the world and handle stressful situations.
### Cognitive Functions
1. **Dominant Function**: This is the most developed and used function. It represents our comfort zone and mastery.
2. **Auxiliary Function**: It complements the dominant function and helps balance the personality.
3. **Tertiary Function**: Less developed, it serves as a backup when the auxiliary function fails.
4. **Inferior Function**: This is our weak point, often revealed in stressful or vulnerable situations.
## Conclusion
The MBTI is a powerful tool for understanding behavioral preferences and personality types. By exploring the four dimensions and cognitive functions, you can better understand your strengths and weaknesses, and thus improve your interactions with others and your personal development.
