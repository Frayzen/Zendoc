# Summary of Courses on MBTI, Conflict Management, and Leadership
## 1. The 4 Dimensions of MBTI
### 1.1. **Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I)**
- **Extraversion (E)**: Draws energy from social interactions, prefers action, variety, and expansion. Extraverts express themselves spontaneously and have intense communication.
- **Introversion (I)**: Draws energy from their inner world, prefers reflection, concentration, and restraint. Introverts show reserve and prefer deep interactions.
### 1.2. **Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N)**
- **Sensing (S)**: Focuses on concrete facts, details, and the present. Sensing-oriented individuals proceed step-by-step and use proven methods.
- **Intuition (N)**: Focuses on future possibilities, connections between ideas, and global patterns. Intuitive-oriented individuals proceed in bursts and use original methods.
### 1.3. **Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F)**
- **Thinking (T)**: Makes decisions based on logic, objectivity, and principles. Thinkers are critical, independent, and task-centered.
- **Feeling (F)**: Makes decisions based on values, harmony, and relationships. Feeling-oriented individuals are empathetic, seek harmony, and are relationship-centered.
### 1.4. **Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P)**
- **Judging (J)**: Likes structure, planning, and quick decision-making. Judging-oriented individuals prefer to act within a structure and plan activities.
- **Perceiving (P)**: Prefers flexibility, improvisation, and keeping options open. Perceiving-oriented individuals prefer to follow the flow of things and be spontaneous.

## 2. Conflict Management
### 2.1. **Definition of Conflict**
A conflict arises when the concerns of two parties seem incompatible. It can be related to disagreements over facts, methods, goals, or values.
### 2.2. **Conflict Management Modes (TKI)**
1. **Competing (Forcing)**: Win-Lose, based on domination. Useful in emergencies or to enforce unpopular decisions.
2. **Collaborating**: Win-Win, seeks innovative solutions. Ideal for solving complex problems and gaining everyone's commitment.
3. **Compromising**: Shares benefits, seeks a fair agreement. Useful when goals are important but do not justify an authoritarian approach.
4. **Avoiding**: Lose-Lose, avoids conflict. Useful when the issue is minor or when there is more to lose than to gain.
5. **Accommodating**: Lose-Win, prioritizes harmony. Useful when the relationship is more important than the outcome.

## 3. Leadership Styles
### 3.1. **The 4 Leadership Styles**
1. **Directive**: Task-centered, the manager decides and controls. Effective in the short term but may limit autonomy.
2. **Persuasive**: Engagement-centered, the manager seeks to convince and involve. Convincing but can be perceived as paternalistic.
3. **Participative**: Team-centered, the manager listens and advises. Promotes collaboration but can be time-consuming.
4. **Delegative**: Empowerment-centered, the manager sets goals and controls from a distance. Develops autonomy but may be perceived as abandonment.
### 3.2. **Adapting Leadership Style**
- **Based on Personalities**: Leadership styles should adapt to the MBTI preferences of team members (ST, SF, NF, NT).
- **Based on Autonomy**: Leadership style should vary according to the level of autonomy of team members (low, moderate, high).
- **Based on Organizational Culture**: Leadership style should align with the organization's culture (mechanical, biological, contractual, rational).
