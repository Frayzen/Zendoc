> [!important] The line 10 does not admit a good complexity. Instead, it is better to add only the source in the queue originally and enqueue the vertices visited (between line 16 and 17)
  
# To remember
- del_min_list
- initialize L = [ ], dist, p
- append src to L
- while L â‰  [ ]
    - x = del_min_list
    - for x adjs
        - standard if
            - add y to L if dist[y] = inf
        - standard update
- return (p, dist)
