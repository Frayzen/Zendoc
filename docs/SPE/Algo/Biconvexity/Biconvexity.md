Biconvexity is a property of graphs in which any two vertices are connected by at least two vertex-disjoint paths. This means that the graph remains connected even if any single vertex or edge is removed. Biconvexity is a useful property in network design and analysis, as it ensures greater robustness and reliability of the network.
