The electromotive force is a difference of potential : it is then R x I

# Notes

> [!important] The previous video explains how to find a current based on a given flux. The exercices of the lesson ask us to find the flux after a current is applied through the solenoid.
## Surface representation
A surface is represented by a vector perpendicular to it. The vector has the norm of the size of the surface.
In the case of the following example, the flux is maximal.

Since we consider alpha to be the same for each loops, we can sum every loops up in order to find the final flux.
## Flux addition
N stands for the number of loops.
Then: since the loops share the same radius, the final flux = **NBS.**

To induct a current, we need a variation of the flux through time. It generates a potential difference (electro motive force) epsilon.

> Electro Motive Force is **not a force** but a voltage.
If the circuit is closed, there is current !
