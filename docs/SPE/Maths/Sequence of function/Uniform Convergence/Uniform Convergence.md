> [!important] If the function f (when it CV pw) is not continuous and f_n is â‡’ it does not CVU
## To show:
1. show the series converges[[Pointwise Convergence]][[PW Convergence]]
2. Find the [[SPE/Algo/Revision Sheet/Revision Sheet]]of fn and prove it goes to zero as n goes to infinity.
$\text{Sup}_{x \in A} \lvert f_n(x) - f(x) \rvert \xrightarrow[n \to \infty]{} 0 \implies (f_n)\space CVU.$

> [!important] if sup
> 
> **does not tend to zero as n goes to infinity** then the series **does not** converge uniformly
# Properties of Uniform converging Sequences of functions
we can use any of these properties contra-positive to prove it does not cvg-u

> [!important] ^ here when using the contra-positive, we will usually chose a sequence that cancels out n in f_n
