## Usage
A CMOS is used to create an output from a given conditional boolean formula.
## Composition
A CMOS circuit is a combinaison of a **pullup** a **pulldown** circuit on top of each other.
- The pullup circuit is responsible for linking the output (Z) to the current source if the condition is valid.
- The pulldown circuit is responsible for linking the ouptut (Z) to the ground if the condition is NOT valid.

> In any case, the output Z is connect to either the ground or the current source
The pullup circuit is made of [[Metal Oxyde Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOFSET)]][[Junction Field Effect Transistor (JFET)]]whereas the pulldown circuit is made of [[Metal Oxyde Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOFSET)]].

As we can see, MOFSET can be used as switches depending on an input. We can now build the pullup and pulldown circuit given any boolean value.
