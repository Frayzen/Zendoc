Atoms are made of electrons and compose every material in the world. Some material called “conducting materials” allow electrons to move from atoms to atoms. This is the **current**.
To provide more or less electron in the material, we are going to apply some **dopage**:
- P-dopage is made of Boron and is going to create holes into the material.
- N-dopage is made of Phosphorus and is going to provide extra electrons in the material.
## PN Junction
![[Untitled 20.png|Untitled 20.png]]
When we put next to each other a P-doped and a N-doped material, we create a PN junction. The region of contact is gonna allow some electron from N-doped material to go in holes of the P-doped material.
This region is called the depletion region.
If we connect P-type to the positive terminal and N-type to the negative terminal of the battery, then the depletion layer reduces. It is called **forward bias**.
When we connect P-type to the negative terminal and N-type to the positive terminal of the battery, the depletion layer widens. It is called **reverse bias**. In this case, current cannot flow through the junction, making it an insulator.
By applying a voltage to the gate of the MOSFET, we can control the width of the depletion region and, therefore, the flow of current between the source and the drain. This makes the MOSFET a useful tool for amplification or switching in electronic circuits.
