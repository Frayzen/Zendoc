title: "Laplacian"

Example Input: (a, b, c) â†’ vector
xy^2 + z^3 â†’ field
Example output: (aâ€™â€™, bâ€™â€™, câ€™â€™) â†’ vector
2x + 6z â†’ field
Infos: double derivative
Output: same type

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Takes **both vector and scalar-valued** and returns **the same type**

</aside>

It is the second derivative of the function

$$
\Delta v = div(\vec{grad}(\vec{A}))
$$

We end up with a scalar (need to sum every component of the vector up at the end) or vector
