The electromotive force is a difference of potential : it is then R x I

# Notes

<aside>
ℹ️ The previous video explains how to find a current based on a given flux. The exercices of the lesson ask us to find the flux after a current is applied through the solenoid.

## Surface representation

A surface is represented by a vector perpendicular to it. The vector has the norm of the size of the surface.

In the case of the following example, the flux is maximal. 

![Untitled](Magnetic%20induction/Untitled%204.png)

Since we consider alpha to be the same for each loops, we can sum every loops up in order to find the final flux.

## Flux addition

N stands for the number of loops.

Then: since the loops share the same radius, the final flux = **NBS.**

![Untitled](Magnetic%20induction/Untitled%205.png)

To induct a current, we need a variation of the flux through time. It generates a potential difference (electro motive force) epsilon.

> Electro Motive Force is **not a force** but a voltage.

If the circuit is closed, there is current !
