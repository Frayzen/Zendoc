Allow negative cost: No
Type of algorithm: One point to one point
remember: closed, openheap

# Principle

A star algorithm is a variation of Dijkstra so it allows circuits but not negative weights. It uses a heap to store nodes along with their current distance plus their heuristic. The heuristic vector is created beforehand.
