# Algorithms

(both work for negative costs and cycles but the graph must be connected and un-directed)

# Definition

## Spanning subgraph

If a subgraphÂ ***H***Â is drawn by

- removing only aÂ **few**Â (orÂ **all**)Â **edges**
- but retainingÂ **all**Â theÂ ***vertices***Â (points) of a graphÂ **G**Â *,*

the subgraphÂ ***H***Â is called as a Spanning Subgraph.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ A spanning subgraph is NOT necessarily a tree, it has to be connected AND acyclic to be so.

### Example

## Spanning tree (ST)

A ST (Spanning Tree) is obtained, for a connected graph G, building a partial graph of G that is a tree. that is to say connected and acyclic. We can see in figure 1 a connected graph with two possible examples of spanning tree.

## Minimal spanning tree (MST)

The spanning tree problem consists to find a partial graph of G which is connected and whose cost is minimum. Such a graph can not have a cycle, otherwise the deletion of one of its edges would give a graph with a less cost and a best spanning tree candidate. As it is connected it is a tree and whose cost is minimum.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ A minimal spanning tree is **not** unique
