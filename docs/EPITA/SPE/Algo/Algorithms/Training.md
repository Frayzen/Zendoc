## Spanning subtree

[https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~langer/251/E8-MST.pdf](https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~langer/251/E8-MST.pdf)

### Ex 1

There are 5 cities. The cost of building a road directly between i and j is the entry ai,jÂ in the matrix below. An indefinite entry indicates that the road cannot be built. Determine the least cost of making all the cities reachable from each other.

ðŸ’¡ Use the [Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm](Spanning%20tree/Kruskal.md) way

- Answer
    
    We order the edges according to the weights: 12, 23, 13, 45, 25, 15, 24, 35, 14 (raw-column).
    
    Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm accepts edges 12, 23, then rejects 13, then accepts 45, 25, and then it stops.
    
    Thus, the least cost to build the road network is 3 + 3 + 7 + 8 = 21.
