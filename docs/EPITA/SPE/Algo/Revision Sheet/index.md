- a path is some arcs
- a chain is some edges

closed path / chain ⇒ length = 0

path / chain vertices distincts ⇒ elementary

closed path + elementary = circuit

Tarjan is used to determine the strongly connected components of a directed graph (uses stack)

Kosaraju is used to determine the strongly connected components of a directed graph (reverses + stack)

a lock is either:

- an edge

a 2-conneted component is:

- a maximum block
- a biconnected graph

Partial graph: takes any number of **existing vertices** and some of the **existing edges**

: takes any number of **existing vertices** and any **edges (new ones potentially)**

## Sub graph

## Spanning Sub Graph

A subgraph takes any number of edges and the associated vertices but **NO MORE**.

A spanning sub graph takes any number of edges and any points from the graph (no correlation)

**EXAMPLE:**

- subset of

- include all vertices
- subset of edges
- preserves connectivity
