## 1. The 8 Cognitive Functions of MBTI

### 1.1. **Gathering Information: Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N)**

- **Sensing (S)**: Focuses on concrete facts, details, and the present. Uses the five senses to perceive the world.
    - **Se (Extraversion)**: Experiences the external world with detailed and immediate perception.
    - **Si (Introversion)**: Recalls past experiences with precision, using a rich internal memory.
- **Intuition (N)**: Focuses on future possibilities, connections between ideas, and global patterns.
    - **Ne (Extraversion)**: Brainstorms and explores new ideas, connecting elements to create innovative solutions.
    - **Ni (Introversion)**: Has an internal vision, perceives invisible patterns and deep meanings.

### 1.2. **Making Decisions: Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F)**

- **Thinking (T)**: Makes decisions based on logic, objectivity, and principles.
    - **Te (Extraversion)**: Organizes and structures the external world by applying rules and standards.
    - **Ti (Introversion)**: Analyzes and breaks down situations to create a coherent internal logic.
- **Feeling (F)**: Makes decisions based on values, harmony, and relationships.
    - **Fe (Extraversion)**: Harmonizes relationships and interactions, focusing on the needs of others.
    - **Fi (Introversion)**: Evaluates internal values, seeks to create inner harmony and respect personal convictions.

## 2. Conflict Management

### 2.1. **Definition of Conflict**

A conflict arises when the concerns of two parties seem incompatible. It can be related to disagreements over facts, methods, goals, or values.

### 2.2. **Positive and Negative Aspects of Conflict**

- **Destructive Aspects**: Communication breakdown, waste of resources, stress, and demotivation.
- **Positive Aspects**: Stimulates innovation, strengthens team cohesion, encourages the search for better solutions.

### 2.3. **Conflict Management Models**

- **TKI Model (Thomas-Kilmann)**: Identifies five conflict management modes:
    1. **Competing (Forcing)**: Win-Lose, based on domination.
    2. **Collaborating**: Win-Win, seeks innovative solutions.
    3. **Compromising**: Shares benefits, seeks a fair agreement.
    4. **Avoiding**: Lose-Lose, avoids conflict.
    5. **Accommodating**: Lose-Win, prioritizes harmony.

### 2.4. **Tips for Managing Conflicts**

- **Open Dialogue**: Describe the facts, explore viewpoints, express needs.
- **Seek Solutions**: Generate options, decide together, implement and check results.

## 3. Leadership Styles

### 3.1. **The 4 Leadership Styles**

1. **Directive**: Task-centered, the manager decides and controls. Effective in the short term but may limit autonomy.
2. **Persuasive**: Engagement-centered, the manager seeks to convince and involve. Convincing but can be paternalistic.
3. **Participative**: Team-centered, the manager listens and advises. Promotes collaboration but can be time-consuming.
4. **Delegative**: Empowerment-centered, the manager sets goals and controls from a distance. Develops autonomy but may be perceived as abandonment.

### 3.2. **Adapting Leadership Style**

- **Based on Personalities**: Leadership styles should adapt to the MBTI preferences of team members (ST, SF, NF, NT).
- **Based on Autonomy**: Leadership style should vary according to the level of autonomy of team members (low, moderate, high).
- **Based on Organizational Culture**: Leadership style should align with the organization's culture (mechanical, biological, contractual, rational).

## 4. The Problem-Solving Cycle

### 4.1. **The Steps of the Cycle**

1. **Diagnosis**: Gather facts and data (Sensing).
2. **Analysis**: Explore connections and interpretations (Intuition).
3. **Decision**: Apply logic and evaluate options (Thinking).
4. **Implementation**: Communicate and motivate the people involved (Feeling).

### 4.2. **Role of MBTI Functions in the Cycle**

- **Sensing (S)**: Gathers facts and data.
- **Intuition (N)**: Explores possibilities and connections.
- **Thinking (T)**: Applies logic and evaluates solutions.
