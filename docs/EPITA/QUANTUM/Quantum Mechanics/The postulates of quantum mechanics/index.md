# 1  The space of states

- **Postulate 1:**
    
    Every isolated physical system is associated with a complex
    vector space with a scalar product (i.e., a Hilbert space) known as the
    state space of the system. The system is completely described by its
    state vector, which is a unit vector in the state space of the system.
    
- Note that this does not say, for a given physical system, what the state
space of this system is, nor what the state vector of the system is.
- The quantum mechanical system that will interest us most is the qubit whose
state space is two-dimensional
- suppose that $| 0 \rangle$ and $|1 \rangle$ for an orthonaml basis for this state space. All vectros can be written in the form $| \psi \rangle = a |0 \rangle + b |1 \rangle$ where $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers
- we have the condition that $\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = 1$ so $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$
- In fact, there are real physical systems that can be described in terms of qubits
- For now, however, it is enough to think of qubits in abstract terms
- the main different is that the super positions of the forme $a |0 \rangle + b |1 \rangle$ can eixit where it is not possible to be defintite which state it is in
- we sat that the linar combination $\sum_i \alpha _i |\psi _i \rangle$ is the super position of the two states

## 2 Temporal Evolution

- a quantum system, like any physics system, evolved over the ocurse of time
- the following postulate allows us to describe this temporal evolution within the framework of hilbert spaces

**Postulate 2:**

The evolution of a closed quantum system is described by a
unitary transformation. In other words, the state $| \psi \rangle$ of the system at time $t_1$
is linked to the unitary state $| \psi '\rangle$ which only depends on times $t_1$ and $t_2$, i.e.
$| \psi ' \rangle$ 
• Note that it is not indicated which unitary operators U describe the evolution
over time of a real quantum system.
