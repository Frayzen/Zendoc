- start with two classes initial and not initial
- for each state in he set:
    - for each letter in Î£, put the child state with all its predecessors
    - if any of the predecessors are not in the class we have a conflict and split the class with the predecessors for that child state
- repeat until no confilcts

here we can see that 5 has parents 5, 2 and 4 with letter b

since 2 and 4 are not in the current class, we remove 5 from the class

here 5 has parents 5 and 1 with letter a

since 5 is not in the current class we remove 1 from the class
