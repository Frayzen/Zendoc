# Instructions

prefix **MNEMONIC SRC, DST**

- Mnemonic is the human readable representation of an **OPCODE**
- Operands (src and dst) are the parameters of the instruction (like 2 and 3 in the addition 2 + 3)

Operations are made by the **ALU** (arithmetic and logical unit) such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT and ADD, SUB, MUL, DIVâ€¦

# Registers

Small internal storage space

**Pro:** really fast

**Cons:** not very large amount of data

They are used as source and destination for most of our operands

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ All CPUs have registers but names can differ

- The current instruction (a pointer to the instruction stored in the RAM) is stored in the program counter register or **RIP**.
- The stack pointer **SP** represent the top of the stack. It increments as it grows and decrements as it diminishes.

There exists other registers such as **control register**.

- rax â†’ Accumator (but also normally has the return of a function)
- rbx â†’callee saved, frame pointer or base pointer for memory access
- rcx â†’ counter

## Data types

### Memory

- using [ ] with a register in between is dereferencing it
- mov eax edx   â€” same as in c â€”   eax = edx
- mov eax [edx]   â€” same as in c â€”   eax = *edx

### Arrays

- to define an array we need to give it a name, size of elements and the elements themselves.
- also we need to define whether its in the .data or .rodata section
    - .data = initilized data, can change at runtime
    - .rodta = (read only), constant
    
    ```nasm
    section .rdata
    my_string db 'Hello', 0  ; Constant string in the .rdata section
    ```
    
    ```nasm
    section .data
    my_array dq 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  ; An array of 64-bit integers
    ```
    
    - above we use dq to define the size of elements.
        - q = 64 bits (quintessential â†’ means everything)
        - d = 32 bits (double)
        - w = 16 bits (word)
        - b = 8 bits (byte)
