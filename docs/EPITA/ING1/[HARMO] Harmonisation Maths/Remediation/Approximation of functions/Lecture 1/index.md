# Up to now

For now, functions f: R â†’ R have been analyzed:

- limit study
- compute derivative
- study of sign of fâ€™
- variations of f
- study remarkable points

**Can we replace the study of f by the study of functions we know better ?** 

â†’ sequence of functions

# Functions more or less similar

functions sharing some variations on same interval + same inflection point are called similar

f: x â†’ xÂ²

g: x â†’ 2xÂ²

<aside>
ðŸ§  **Inflexion point:** point where the SECOND derivative changes its sign

## 3 types of approximations

- Linear approximations
**Exemple**

$$
ax+b
$$

- Polynomial approximation
**Exemple**

$$
ax^2+bx+c
$$

- Approximation for Taylor Series
**Exemple**

$$
cos(x) = 1 - \frac{xÂ²}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} -...
$$

**Why approximate functions ?**

â‡’ Make it easy to study (*max, min, limitsâ€¦*)

Distance is an applications d : E x E â†’ R+

# Vector space

A vector space has an intern law (+) and extern law (.)

Let E be a vector space and u,v,w belongs to it

Let a,b be scalars.

The **intern law** is an abelien group:

- commutative
- associative
- there exists a unique 0 element
- every element has a symmetric so that u+v = 0

The **extern law** (*multiplication by scalar)* ****is:

- associative u(vw) = (uv)w
- valid 1.u = u
- distributive from addition (a+b)u = au+bu
- distributive from intern law (u+v).w = u.w+v.w

## Norm on a vector space

The norm (*written || . ||* ) is a function from E â†’ [0, +inf[ satisfying:

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ As soon as we defined a **norm** we can define a **distance** by:
d(x,y) = N(x-y)
*This is the generalization of what we already do one R â‡’ d(x,y) = | x - y |*
