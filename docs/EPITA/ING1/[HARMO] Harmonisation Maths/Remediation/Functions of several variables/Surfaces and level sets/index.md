# 2D Surface

we can define a 2D surface within a 3D space by an equation of the form

$$
z = f(x,y)
$$

$$
0 = F(x,y,z)
$$

# Level set

To study more finely such surface we can introduce the concept of level set defined by the equation:

$$
c = f(x,y)
$$

Which is the set of all values satisfying the equation
