# Definition

Partition of a set
A (possibly infinite) set of sets P is said to be a partition of E if it verifies
the following properties:
**Non-empty subset**. âˆ€X âˆˆ P, X âŠ† E and X Ì¸= âˆ….
**Disjointness**. âˆ€X, Y âˆˆ P,(X â‰  Y ) â‡’ (X âˆ© Y = âˆ…).
**Coverage**. âˆ€x âˆˆ E, âˆƒX âˆˆ P, x âˆˆ X.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ The last two properties yield the conclusion âˆ€x âˆˆ E, âˆƒ!X âˆˆ P, x âˆˆ X.
