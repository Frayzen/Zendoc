# Definition

A set is a well-defined collection of objects

All objects in a set have to be unique

<aside>
👁️ *{1,1,2} is NOT a set*

</aside>

The order does not matter

<aside>
👁️ *{1,0,2} and {0,1,2} represent the same set*

</aside>

A set as 2^n subsets

## Similarities

AUB and PvQ

AnB and P^Q

A subset B and P ⇒ Q

A = B and P≤>Q

<aside>
🧠 You should already know that N ⊆ Z ⊆ Q ⊆ R ⊆ C
