# ∀

We introduce the universal logical quantifier ∀ such that, given a set
E, ∀x ∈ E means “for all x belonging to the set E”

In “∀x ∈ E, P(x).”, we say that P(x) is quantified by ∀x ∈ E.

<aside>
💡 The proposition ∀x ∈ ∅, P(x) is always true, regardless of P

</aside>

# ∃

We introduce the existential logical quantifier ∃ such that, given a
set E, ∃x ∈ E means “there exists an x belonging to the set E”.

<aside>
💡 The proposition ∃x ∈ ∅, P(x) is always false, regardless of P.
As a consequence, ∃x ∈ E ⇐⇒ E ̸= ∅.
