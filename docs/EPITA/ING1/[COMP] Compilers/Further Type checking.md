We need another method if we have classes → for TC-O

## Subtyping

The notation $X\le Y$ means:

- $X$ is a sub class of $Y$
- $X$ comforts to $Y$ (Java, $X$ can have some of $Y$’s behavior)
- An object of type $X$ can be used when an object of type $Y$ would have been acceptable

Those 3 definitions are complementary and equivalent
