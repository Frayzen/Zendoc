### Compiler Definition

A compiler is a program that accepts as input a program text in a certain language and produces as output a program text in another language, while preserving the meaning of that text

🚧 Good definition if we don’t talk about abstraction

## Coarse-grained steps in GCC

Actually between 50 and 60 steps (see later)

### Processor

source code → source code (multiple file to multiple file)

- make the job of the compiler easier
- macro expansion
- no processioning in this course

### Actual C Compiler

- Many challenges:
- Lexing, Parsing,
- Type checking
- Linearizing
- SSA
- Register allocation
- Optimisation
- …

### Assembler

- An assembler translates assembly language programs into **machine code.**
- The output of an assembler is called an object file, which contains a combination of machine instructions as well as the data required to place these instructions in memory.
- example : **gcc -S foo.c && as foo.s -o foo.o**

### Linker

- A linker is a program that links and merges various object files together in order to make an executable file.
- The major task of a linker is to search and locate referenced module/routines in a program and to determine the memory location where these codes will be loaded, making the program instruction to have absolute references.
- example : **ld foo.o -o foo -lSystem**
- Call other programs from a program

### Cross Compiler

- A cross-compiler is a compiler capable of creating executable code for a platform other than the one on which the compiler is running.
    - allows developers to target specific architectures or platforms without needing to compile on the target machine directly
- Regardless on the machine you are on
- example : **aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc -o main main.c
                qemu-aarch64 main**
- used for embedded systems of when targeting platforms on different archis

## Bootstrapping

### Definition

The technique for producing a self-compiling compiler

- Writing the compiler in the language it is compiling
- Advantages:
    - Developers only need to know and work in one language
    - Non-trivial test of the language being compiled
    - Improvement of compiler generated code benefits both compiler and users programs
- examples of bootstrap compiler
    
    
    - C++ (clang)
    - C (gcc)
    - Go
    - Java (not the runtime)
    - Ada (gnat)
    - Haskell (ghc)
    - Delphi
    - Common Lisp
    - Eiffel
    - Rust
    - Ocaml
    - Zig
    - Tiger (WIP)

Interpreter = Front + Middle

Going from cpp to c is called a transpiler 

## Back-end

- Instr. select
- Reg. Alloc

## Middle

- Lowering/ translate
- Option

## Front-End

- Lex/parse
- Semantic analysis
- Segmentation
    - Binding
    - Typing
- Code generation
