- neural networks are just functions
    - input all the variables
    - function its elf is all the weights and biases
    - varies (example: vector representing probabilities that an image is classified and we choose the highest)
    
- its all about minimizing the cost

$$
 \frac{\delta Cost}{\delta w}
$$
