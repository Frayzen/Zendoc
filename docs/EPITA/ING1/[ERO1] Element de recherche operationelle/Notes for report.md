### Use ressources givem

Split the montreal graph in subgraph for each sectors

To represent the graph we use osmnx library, street = edge and nodes = intersections

With the library : how to get total street length and how you provide a path

How to represent it visually → matplotlib to display whole city and a path animation (see start end)

### Map the city / sector with drone

Chinese Postman algorithm (undirected) to go through the graph with a minimal cost → returns a path

Using the path we calculate the total distance of the path and deduce the cost

### Strongly connected

Make the graph strongly connected

Decided to use algorithm to determine the strongly connected component and identifie the edges that cause the graph to not be strongly connected

2 options for making it strongly connected:

- Remove “dead ends”
- Use external streets

Only 1 or 2 dead ends by sector → remove / ignore them

### Spliting graph for each snowplows

Tried to split into strongly connected subgraphs → too difficult

More tricky because it had to have a common street

Given the time we changed the approach

But mostly the difference in optimization / cost between Eulerian cycle and Eulerian path

Cycle → more already seen edges

Path : faster to compute + lest costly + easier to implement

⇒ Given a graph we will use directed chinese postman

We find the eulerian path

Depending on the set of plows we are using we will split it accordingly so they all finish at the same time

Graph of different situation with time and cost (ex: 2 level 1 plows)

To view we can see each path individually or all on one graph
