# Storage

- Reminder about primary storage
    
    ![Untitled](RAM%20management/Untitled.png)
    
    - **primary**
    (can be used directly by CPU)
    - **secondary**
    (is permanent ‚Äì has to be kept synchronous)
    - **tertiary**
    (only for backups)

<aside>
üß† **Primary storage:** The **only** storage the CPU can address directly

# Stating the problem

**Problem**: While some address values in program data are set during compilation, the specific location of a process in RAM is uncertain. This presents challenges:

- **Multitasking**: In multitasking systems, multiple processes share the same RAM simultaneously, which can lead to conflicts.
- **Hardcoded Addresses**: Programs with hardcoded addresses can't adapt to changing RAM locations.
- **Fragmentation**: To avoid wasted space, we need to manage RAM efficiently and minimize fragmentation.
- **Protection and Isolation**: Each process must run as if it's the only one in RAM, ensuring protection and isolation from other processes.

# Solutions

[Segmentation](RAM%20management/Segmentation.md)

[Paging](RAM%20management/Paging.md)

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Segmentation is **old** and **paging** is way more used nowadays
