### Jacquart 1801

Fully automated looms, driven by punch cards

## Baddage Machine

A machine driven by punched-cards. The first general purpose computer. (Turing 100 years before)

### Z1 and Z3 1936

Fist calculator. Destroyed by war.

## UNIVAC 1 - 1951

First commercially available general-purpose computer

Feature a 12Kb magnetic tape unit as buffer memory.

# Fortan

Goal : used statisfaction. Industrial language, not academic.

- Easy to learn → for scientists
- Easy to write → compared to assembly
- Easy to work with
- Efficient

## ALGOL

For academic

As close as possible to the usual mathematial notations

Readable without assistance

Automatically translatable into machine code (no assembly)

## COBOL - 1959

Reduce language switching costs

Requested by US defense  → COBOL compiler

Using English words and syntax in programming languages

# Lisp - 1960

First functional programming language.

**Introduces:**

- S-Expression
- Recursion
- Conditionals
- First class functions
- Expression-based prog
- Homoiconicity
- Garbage collection

# ALGOL 60

Use of BNF to describe the syntax

Block structure

### First Video Game - 1962

Space War

## BASIC - 1964

Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code

### Simula 67 - 1967

First OOP language

## Intel & AMD - 1968-69

From The Traitorous Eight leaving Shockley Semiconductor 

### ALGOL 68

Focused on orthogonality and security

Adds a myriad of concepts to ALGOL 60

Very criticized → mainly for complexity compared to ALGOL 60

Revised in 73 but too late

## Pascal - 1970

Keep the ALGOL 60 structure but with Fortan’s perf

## UNIX - 1969

Ken Thompson implements it in 1 month to play Space Travel (video game)

Originally named UNICS

### 70’s

C, SQL (SEQUEL) and ML

### PL1

Shit language

# First PC - IBM PC 5100

16K to 64K memory

BASIC and APL

Tape drive for program storage

## Microsoft - 1975

## Apple II - 1977

4KiB to 48KiB RAM

### Smalltalk - 1980

Seconf great OOP language (OOP term invented)

Message passing

Every thing is an object defined by its class

### Ada - 1983

Descendant of Pascal

Generic programming

Argument passing nodes

# GNU Project - 1983

To have open source, gain independence

## Macintosh - 1964

First PC with a mouse

## Windows 1.0 - 1985

Not really well recieved

# Perl - 1987

Paved the way for modern dynamic languages such as Python or Ruby

Very feature heavy

Extensive capabilities for string processing (such as builtin regexs)

Somewhat obtuse syntax

Smart but not necessarily readable

## 90’s

## 2000’s

Haskell 90

Python 90

Java 95

Java Script 95

OCaml 96

Tiger! 98

First GPU 99

C# 2001

Git 2005

Go 2009

TypeScript 2012

Swift 2014

Rust 2015
