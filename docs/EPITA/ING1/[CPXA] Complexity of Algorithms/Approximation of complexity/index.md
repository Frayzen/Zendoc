# Method

We proceed line by line to find the order of the complexity

First, set the complexity to Θ(1) and add the maximum number of step induced by each line. As soon as a condition is found, we need to use O(*something*) because we are not sure to enter into the condition.

## Examples

T(n) = Θ(n²)

T(n) = O(n²)
