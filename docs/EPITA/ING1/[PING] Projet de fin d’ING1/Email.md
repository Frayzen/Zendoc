I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention some significant concerns we have regarding our current project coach, Olivier RICOU, and to formally request a change of coach for our project group.

Our project involves developing an IDE for "lazy people," as outlined by our coach. Initially, we were enthusiastic about this unique challenge and approached it with a thorough brainstorming session. We categorized our ideas, created a comprehensive product backlog, and followed the given instructions diligently. Our ideas addressed various issues such as accessibility, productivity, motivation, and ease of use in coding environments. However, during our subsequent interactions with Mister Ricou, we encountered several issues that have greatly hindered our progress and motivation.

**Unclear Requirements and Contradictory Feedback:** During our first meeting, Mister Ricou provided vague and contradictory instructions. For instance, despite presenting well-thought-out features tailored for "lazy people," our coach dismissed our ideas without clear reasoning, stating that we misunderstood the assignment. His feedback was often inconsistent, making it difficult for us to understand the project's goals.

**Unprofessional Conduct:** In our meetings, Olivier Ricou made several remarks that were unprofessional and demotivating. Some of his comments in French included:

- “I feel like I’m seeing the same window 20 times.”
- “What is the basic IDE?”
- “Yeah okay but it’s ugly.”
- “But you didn’t do anything.”
- “Lazy people are happy to be shown their weaknesses.”
- “You just found a flaw in the system, but it’s not serious.”
- “I admit that I no longer know what I said to each of the groups.”
- “I’m sorry I wasn’t clear enough.”
- “I didn’t tell you about the specifications, just the model, but it comes down to the same thing.”
- “I don’t remember how much we discussed carrot stick.”

**Lack of Preparation and Clarity:** Olivier Ricou often seemed unprepared and unsure about the project specifications. This lack of clarity has led to confusion and wasted time for our group.

**Previous Student Feedback:** We have also been informed by students from previous years that Olivier Ricou tends to give significantly lower grades compared to other coaches, averaging 8/20 while others average 15/20. This discrepancy raises concerns about fairness and consistency in evaluation.

Given the significant investment we are making in our education at this institution, both in terms of time and financial resources, it is particularly disheartening to encounter such a lack of engagement and clarity from our project coach. We were initially excited by the challenge of the project, but the coach's apparent indifference and the unclear expectations have made it difficult to stay motivated. It is disappointing to see how little Olivier Ricou seems to care about the project and how little he seemed to know about what he wants from us.

Given these issues, we believe that continuing with Olivier Ricou will severely impact our ability to successfully complete this project and maintain our motivation. We understand the importance of professionalism and presenting our ideas effectively, but the current situation is untenable.

We respectfully request a change of coach to ensure a productive and supportive project environment. We are eager to continue working on this project with renewed motivation and clear guidance. We hope you understand our concerns and can facilitate this change promptly.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance in this matter.

Best regards,

Subject: Formal Request for Change of Project Coach

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing on behalf of our project group to bring to your attention significant concerns we have regarding our current project coach, Olivier RICOU. We would like to formally request a change of coach for our project.

Our project involves developing an IDE for "lazy people," as outlined by our coach. Initially, we were enthusiastic about this unique challenge and approached it with a thorough brainstorming session. We categorized our ideas, created a comprehensive product backlog, and followed the given instructions diligently. Our ideas addressed various issues such as accessibility, productivity, motivation, and ease of use in coding environments. However, during our subsequent interactions with Mister Ricou, we encountered several issues that have greatly hindered our progress and motivation.

Unclear Requirements and Contradictory Feedback: From one session to another, Mister Ricou provided vague and contradictory instructions. Despite presenting well-thought-out features tailored for "lazy people," our coach dismissed our ideas without clear reasoning, stating that we misunderstood the assignment. His feedback was often inconsistent, making it difficult for us to understand the project's goals.

Unprofessional Conduct: In our meetings, Olivier Ricou made several remarks that were unprofessional and demotivating. Some of his comments included:

“I feel like I’m seeing the same window 20 times.”

From what we have learned in our conception class, this is a method we are familiar with in which small adjustments are made at each iteration to develop our idea. 
“Yeah okay but it’s ugly.”

We understand the need to give us a feedback. However, we do not find this a constructive criticism.
“But you didn’t do anything.”

Considering the misleading information and the indirect instructions we were provided with, we found this comment 
“Lazy people are happy to be shown their weaknesses.”

This is a typical quote of what confuses us about our coach. This quote is highly arguable and not straight forward at all. The coach however seems to base all of his leading process on this kind of thoughts.
“You just found a flaw in the system, but it’s not serious.”

This quote was said in the context of an idea provided by the coach. One of the member of the group pointed out an obvious drawback and the teacher’s reaction points out that the teacher does not tend to question himself. 
“I admit that I no longer know what I said to each of the groups.”

“I don’t remember how much we discussed […].”

The teacher was not taking any notes during session. We expect him to follow us closer. 
“I’m sorry I wasn’t clear enough.”
“I didn’t tell you about the specifications, just the model, but it comes down to the same thing.”

After forgetting to mention us we needed to bring specifications with us on the next week, the coach argued that the creation of a prototype for the IDE always goes along with a specification book. We expect to be told at least what kind of material we should hand back for each session.

Lack of Preparation and Clarity: Olivier Ricou often seemed unprepared and unsure about the project specifications. He omits critical information and does not take notes during our sessions, which leads to recurring confusion. For instance, he only mentioned working on the "prototype" without clarifying that specifications were needed, causing us to miss essential aspects of the project.

Communication Issues: Communication with Mister Ricou has been extremely challenging. He does not listen to any of us, and this has led to significant misunderstandings and a lack of direction. Additionally, he does not question himself or reflect on his feedback, which makes it difficult to resolve any issues or misunderstandings.

Previous Student Feedback: We have also been informed by students from previous years that Olivier Ricou tends to give significantly lower grades compared to other coaches . This discrepancy raises concerns about fairness and consistency in evaluation.

Lack of Concept Integration: The conception class is not referenced at all in his guidance, which is unexpected and problematic for our project development.

Given the significant investment we are making in our education at this institution, both in terms of time and financial resources, it is particularly disheartening to encounter such a lack of engagement and clarity from our project coach. We were initially excited by the challenge of the project, but the coach's apparent indifference and the unclear expectations have made it difficult to stay motivated.

Given these issues, we believe that continuing with Olivier Ricou will severely impact our ability to successfully complete this project and maintain our motivation. We understand the importance of professionalism and presenting our ideas effectively, but the current situation is untenable.

We would appreciate the opportunity to discuss these concerns further in person to provide more context and detail. We respectfully request a change of coach to ensure a productive and supportive project environment. We are eager to continue working on this project with renewed motivation and clear guidance. We hope you understand our concerns and can facilitate this change promptly.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance in this matter.
