## Mathematical definition of a signal

A signal is defined as a function

$$
x : I \subseteq \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C} \newline t\ \mapsto\ x(t)
$$

that satisfies :

$$
\to x\ is\  bounded \ (in\  magnitude)\ :\  âˆƒ \ 0 < M < +âˆž \ \ such\ that\ \ |x(t)| < M\ \  âˆ€t âˆˆ I
\newline\to\ x\ is\ continuous\ or\ has\ a \ finite\ or\ countable \ infinity \ of\  discontinuities.
$$

ðŸ’¡ Remarks :

- We restrict ourselves to univariate and one-dimensional signals.
- x can take complex values.
- In general, I = $\mathbb{R}$.
- By abuse of language, we will refer to t as the time variable.
- The graph of x is called the time representation.
- The set of signals is a vector space in which we can define a basis, inner product,
and norm

- Example: Radar

    1. Emission of a reference signal $x_{ref}$ that propagates to the target.
    2. The echo returns to the receiver, which records $x_{echo}$ .
    3. Measurement of the echo delay â‡’ distance to the target.
    â‡’ How to calculate the echo delay most reliably ?
    
    *Idea:* Find the optimal translation factor to superimpose the pattern of $x_{echo}$ on
    $x_{ref}$ to maximize the similarity between these two signals.

## General definitions

- **Bounded support**
    
    $f(x) \text{ has bounded support on } [a,b] \Rightarrow f(x)= 0 \ \forall x < a \ and \ x > b$
    
- **Discrete signal**
    
    A discrete-time signal is *a sequence of values that correspond to particular instants in time*
    

### Analog signal

An analog signal varies in a continuous manner with respect to its input variables and in its output values â€” all measurable physical quantities.

### Digital signal

A digital signal varies in a discrete manner with respect to its input and output values. A discrete signal may be stored in finite memory to be manipulated by a computer.

### Deterministic signal

A deterministic signal is perfectly clean, without external perturbations and without measurement noise.

### Stochastic signal

A stochastic signal, involving one or more random processes (noise), in addition to its normal behavior.
