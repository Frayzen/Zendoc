# Definition
A set is a well-defined collection of objects
All objects in a set have to be unique

> [!important] _{1,1,2} is NOT a set_
  
The order does not matter

> [!important] _{1,0,2} and {0,1,2} represent the same set_
A set as 2^n subsets
## Similarities
AUB and PvQ
AnB and P^Q
A subset B and P ⇒ Q
A = B and P≤>Q

> [!important] You should already know that N ⊆ Z ⊆ Q ⊆ R ⊆ C
