⚡   ≅ → isomorphic relation

# Testing

- same number of vertices
- if two graphs are isomorphic then their compliments are as well
- both graphs have to have the same number of connected “pieces”
- sum of degrees of veities is queal to twice the number of edges
- same vertex degree distribution (histogram)

- must have isomorphic subgraphs
    - be careful : all edges vertices must be in the V set
