# Overview

![Untitled](Payload/Untitled.png)

- Source is before Destination
- Checksum is computed without the header part but rather uses only the payload.
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡  a checksum is a value computed from data to detect errors or ensure data integrity during transmission or storage

- IP protocol is not correlated to [Ethernet Frames](Ethernet%20Frame.md):
    - IP maximum payload is larger than Ethernet maximum payload. If the payload is too large, the IP payload will be sent as several [Ethernet Frames](Ethernet%20Frame.md).
    - IP Packets may be carried by other protocols than Ethernet
