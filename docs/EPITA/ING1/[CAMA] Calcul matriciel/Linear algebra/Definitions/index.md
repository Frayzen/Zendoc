# Isometric Transformations

A shape-preserving transformation a plane or space

- reflection
- translation
- rotation
- or a mix of each

### Orthogonal Automorphism

- orthogonal suggests the angles between them remains constant
- auto morphism refers to a bijective linear transformation, preserves the algebraic structure of the space, meaning it preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication
- examples include:
    - Rotations in Euclidean Space
    - orthogonal matrices: A A^T = I
    - reflections
