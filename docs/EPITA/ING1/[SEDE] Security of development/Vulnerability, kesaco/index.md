# CVE

CVE, short *for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures*, is a list of publicly disclosed information security flaws.

They all have a unique identifier including the year of discover.

![Untitled](Vulnerability,%20kesaco/Untitled.png)

**Examples:**

- [CVE-2020-19909](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2020-19909.html)
- [**CVE-2016-9843**](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2016-9843)

They all have a severity level that is decided by an autonomous group in charge of it (MITRE). Of course, the guy tat found the breach wants the highest severity and the company in charge of the product wants the lowest one.

<aside>
üí° Some CVE are really really specific and will never be looked

Some can be **hypotetic** (suspected an cause an issue)

</aside>

### OpenBSD - Multiple Authentication Vulnerabilities

     One remotely exploitable

Three local privilage escalaion via ‚Äúxlock‚Äù, ‚ÄúS/Key‚Äù, ‚ÄúYubiKey‚Äù and ‚Äúsu‚Äù

# Time Release

- Don‚Äôt release on friday
- Account for vendors
- Have a "secure" channel for bugs
- Worst case scenario: zero days

# Log4J vulnerability

Log4J is a framework in java that provides a login capability for java base app.

The bigest problem was that Log4J has **too many** capabilities.

Java being a modern language, it allowed to run code from outside of the program. The idea was to format and retrieve more information about an issue before logging it initially.

The issue is that if you pass the right the right user agent, you can run any code.

üëÅÔ∏è This is a very high level view of what is going on

# Vulnerability

<aside>
üß† **Stuxnet** is the first malware to ever cause physical damage, virus developed by Israeli and American secret service to make the Iranian nuclear program fail

</aside>

A vulnerability is usually:

- using the input we pass to a program
- usually not a **unique** vulnerability but a chain of vulnerability that leads to critical issues.

Some AI Chat Model had been attached to some security issue finder program but ended up just warning about some very well known issues (such that usage of *strcpy*) even tho the application still handled everything well in this context.

## Timely releases

- Don‚Äôt release on friday
- Account for vendors (there is gonna be a delay between the publication of the patch and the update happening)
- Have a ‚Äúsecure‚Äù channel for bugs
- Worst case scenario: **zero days.** Zero days means that some people found a bug and how to exploit it. You figure out that some application have been hacked

<aside>
üí° Even some government keep some zero days vulnerabilities for themselves.

</aside>

If you see a patch that has not been scheduled before, it is really likely to be a zero day patch.

## How to react to an attack

You could freeze the system attacked because the attacker is likely to put his toolkit in it to attack auxiliary systems. This toolkit is really precious to retrieve.

You need to know your network in any kind of company not only in a technical point of view but also in a sensible information kind of way to know very quickly how severe the attack is.

# Some well known vulnerabilities

## email

Netflix used to allow the creation of account with an email address but didn‚Äôt think about the fact that an email address such as [*myemail@mail.fr](mailto:myemail@mail.fr)* is actually the same as [*myemail+thisadded@mail.fr](mailto:myemail+thisadded@mail.fr)* which allowed users to create several accounts using one mail.

## printf

```c
1 void
2 print_msg(const char *msg)
3 {
4 printf("There is a problem here;\n");
5 printf(msg);
6 }
```

**The issue**

```c
1 void
2 print_msg(const char *msg)
3 {
4 printf("There is a problem here;\n");
5 printf("%s", msg);
6 }
```

**The fix**

## system & popen

Both are basically using

```c
sh -c "${input}"
```

To properly use them you have to quote **everything** ( *#{}()"'`\ $* ).

A better solution would be to use **exec(3)**, it is enough in most of the cases.
