# Introduction

## SAS (software as a service)

As oposition to the old way market (sending a CD once for all so that you can access the software forever), the SAS is the idea that you subscribe (not essentially by paying but more by using) to an application as a service.

*Example: Youtube or Amazon prime is a great example of SAS.*
