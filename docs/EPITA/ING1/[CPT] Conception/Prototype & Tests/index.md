# Overview

The main idea is to create a fake environment, fake context, to create a prototype and get quickly the user feedback. We aim to avoid the biggest mistakes by presenting the core concept of the application to users as fast as possible.

Drawing is very useful and should be used as most as possible.

Once the drawing is satisfying, we can go to Figma like apps.

The aim is to produce the MVP part by part as quickly as possible while dodging all of the mistakes we could have not spotted before.

<aside>
☝ The most the prototype is realist, the most it lacks data.

## User tests

Observe and interview the target users of a product or service to understand the real objectives and figure out the usage difficulties.

<aside>
⚠️ We do not create the product with the client. User tests aim to produce knowledge, not product. Do not modify the product while showing it to users.

</aside>

Why ?

- Validate the usability of the product
- Validate user journey
- Gather the feedback of real users

Who ? The targeted users specific to some criteria.

| Phase | Deliverable |
| --- | --- |
| Exploration | Maquette |
| Evaluation | User tests |
| Validation | Prototype |
| Comparison | Prototype final |
| Amelioration | On market product |

## Creating User tests

1. Define objectives of the test
2. Define protocol of the test
3. Hire users
4. Conduct the tests
5. Restitution of test results

## Types of User tests

Controlled situation test

- In laboratory
- User is isolated
- We record interactions
- We observe alone

Natural context test

- On the field
- User is not isolated but in its own environment
- Record of interactions
- We observe the results

Remote tests

- Synchrone or asynchrone
- That offers a larger amount of user

Guerilla-like tests

- In a public place
- Observation of users
- Less reliable

## Observations

- The journey
- What they liked / succeeded
- The failure, errors...

<aside>
⚠️ A debriefing is also very important

The result analysis can be done using the Jakob Nielsen, Bastin & Scapin or Amelie Boucher grids.
