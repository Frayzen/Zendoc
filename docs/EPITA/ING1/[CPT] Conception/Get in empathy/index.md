# Definition

It is all about defining the feelings and emotions of the users. We specify the fears, beliefs, needs…

- Listen to what people say
- Observe what people do
- Study what people create

Users do not say the same things in group and alone. A very good way to understand them is to look at them doing.

It is primordial to be able to get rid of all predetermined opinions and to take a look at the user without any kind of judgement.

<aside>
☝ We usually don’t have access as often as we need to users. Therefore, the [Acculturation](acculturation) and Get in Empathy steps can be merged while getting in touch with them.

## Approaches

- **Qualitative approach** be exhaustive, go in the detail
- **Quantitative approach** verify opinions by exploring data. Try to wider the “typical” user and take more parameters in account.
    
    <aside>
    ☝ a typical example taken in account in quantitative approach would be the language barrier
    
    </aside>
    

- **Attitude approach:** listen to what users are saying
- **Behavior approach**: looking at what users are doing

## Manage a user interview

<aside>
☝ Do not get in the subject too directly. The discussion has to be open.

</aside>

What ? open converstaion

Why ? understand the environment, the user

Who ? typical user, extreme users, experts…

**Persona = User**

## Do

1. Define objectives of the interview
2. Open questions
3. Understand tasks / activities
4. Remember past / anticipate future
5. Opinions and point of views
6. Express the problems and friction points

### Avoid

- Ask closed question
- Ask directed questions
- Ask what they want
- Make assumptions

## To go further: proto-persona

In the real world, due to the lack of linearity, we can already have a profile that comes up at this step. It will be useful to create a proto-persona. It is only a tool to better manage the meetings…
