# Overview

Ideation is the process by which each one can find ideas and get to be innovating.

Requirements

- Existence of an initial problem
- Divergence of thoughts
- Convergence of thoughts

☝ **Affordance:** the ability to detect a usage by a sign.
Typically: when encountering a new door, you know by instinct how to open it

## Brainstorming (divergence of thoughts)

Generate a maximum amount of idea on a given theme during a group meeting.

It is highly recommended to do it in real life.

After the brainstorming, we sort ideas and group them by similarities. It is the longest work.

We can measure the efficiency of an ideation seance.

- **Novelty**: how new
- **Quantity:** how much
- **Variety:** how different
- **Quality:** how close from requirements and feasible the idea is from reality

<aside>
☝ We cannot say that something is “shit”. Therefore, the MLI method exist. “More Less Intersting”. What is positive in the idea ? What is negative ? What makes that idea intersting ?

How to sort ideas ?

- Feasible
- Time
- Cost
- Efficiency

- Risks
- Team feeling
- Benefits
- Innovative

We can also sort them using prioritization or 2 by 2 matrices. They are useful to sort a large amount of idea. We take 2 criteria on both x and y axis and plot each ideas based on those criteria
