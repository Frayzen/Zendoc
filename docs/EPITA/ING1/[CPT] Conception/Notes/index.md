# Objectives of the class

Experiment useful tools to identify the need and propose a solution that fulfill it partially or fully.

1. Acculturation
2. Get in empathy
3. Definition
4. Ideation: brainstorming
5. Prototype

The main objective is to spot easily the needs and requirements of a client and provide a suited solution.

Isolate an archetype form studies and observations based on empathy in an identified context.

→ We use a persona. Its frustration and expectation to formulate a problematic.

The product aims to be used. The quickest we can propose the experience to the user, the better we can adapt the product.
