# Define the problem

Express explicitly the true question that we try to answer. We focus on the real problematic that we figured out during the previous steps.

- Converge toward a reasonable challenge (aka the most value) = MVP
- Take the frustrations as a basis
- Think about opportunity
- Identify the need to face the challenge

☝ A priority is an issue that involves everyone

## Persona

Fictive but realistic representation of a users of the product / service that gather the same need / expectations.

<aside>
☝ It is a necessary step to identify a **target user.**
