# Definition

Acculturation is the process for a group or a person to learn a new culture/context without any prejudices.

- We all come with the conviction that we know the best solution. That’s **wrong**.
- We should always come with the idea that we know **nothing**.
- We need to acclimate ourselves to the new ecosystem.

☝ The design begins where the developer is not the user anymore.
The expertise of the developer is to learn everything.

The main idea is to figure out a problem.
