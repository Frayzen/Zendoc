### Predecessors

Flavors, Common Loops (portable)

# Characteristics (diff with classic approach)

### 3 Layers â†’ flexible

1. API (syntactic = Macros and not functions â†’ 90% access)
2. API (functional)
3. Implementation

<aside>
ðŸ§  Everything is open (even the 3rd layer)

</aside>

### Generic functions ($\neq$ sending messages)

- Natural extension of classic functions â†’ makes it more expressive
- Sending messages not adapted to the n operations
- Multi-methods
- Methods donâ€™t exist, there is only functions

### Multiple inheritance

Classes can have multiple parents â†’ more expressive

List of mother classes â†’ order for hierarchy (oldest to latest)

### Method combination

To dynamic dispatch - when calling a method it will search the closest implementation (most specific) in hierarchy

Combine all possible methods to give the final result

### MOP - Meta Object Protocol

The object oriented layer of the program is itself implemented object oriented â†’ meta circularity

meta object = generic functions, classes ect

1rst class = anonymous manipulation

Gives a great power of expressiveness

### Dynamic typing (itâ€™s Lisp)

### No encapsulation or protection

No private, protected ect

Need to be cautious yourself, can build it yourself

Orthogonal to object oriented programming
