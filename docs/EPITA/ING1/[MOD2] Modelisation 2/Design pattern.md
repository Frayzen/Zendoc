# Introduction

A design pattern is an already-made solution to common problematic faced by software engineers (as well as other jobs).

<aside>
ðŸ§  However, design pattern are **not** an alternative to good-send or reflexion.

A design pattern can be expressed as:

- A context, problem, solution
- A problem, solution, consequences

A design pattern is subdivided in usage:

- Creation
- Structure
- Behavior

Or in abstraction:

- Architecture
- Conception
- Idiom

This kind of representation has several issues:

- What if I want to add a new method ? I need to replicate it everywhere
- There is a lot of code duplicated

It is really easy to add more visitor1
