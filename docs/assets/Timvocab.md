### gnarly
- pronounced narr-ly (enphasize the arrrrr)

### Gronk
- often used informally to refer to a person who is perceived as foolish, clumsy, or lacking in intelligence
- ==**not always used in a derogatory way, and in some contexts, it might be used more playfully or affectionately among friends**==
- examples:
    
    - Mate, you're such a gronk for forgetting your keys again!
    - Don't be a gronk, help us out with the project
    - He's a bit of a gronk, but he's a good bloke
    
      
    
### Fuckoff

- i mean to exagerate or emphasize : “i was on a fuckoff boat”
- or “i was on a big fuckoff boat”
- both work
# fuckery
