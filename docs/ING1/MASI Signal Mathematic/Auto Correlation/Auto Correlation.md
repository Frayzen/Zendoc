$\Gamma_{xx}(\tau) = ⟨x(t), x(t − τ )⟩ = \int _{\mathbb{R}}  
x(t) \overline{x(t − \tau)}dt$

## Some properties
- Any signal that has a [[Signal Classification]] admits a finite auto correlation
    
    $\forall x \in \mathcal{L}^2({\mathbb{R}}), |\Gamma_{xx}(\tau)| < \infty$
    
- The value of the auto correlation in 0 is the [[Energy and Power]]
    
    $\Gamma_{xx}(0) = E_x$
    
- The auto correlation is maximal in 0
