# Programming Paradigms
Foundational approach or methodology for designing and implementing computer programs. It constitutes a set of principles, concepts, and patterns that guide the development of software by providing a framework for problem-solving and expressing computations.
  
### Common Paradigms
- **Functional Programming**
    
    Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It encourages immutability and the use of pure functions.
    
    Haskell, Lisp, Scala
    
- **Imperative Programming**
    
    Focuses on describing how a program operates by specifying a series of statements that change a program's state.
    
    C, Pascal, Fortran
    
- **Declarative Programming**
    
    Emphasizes what the program should accomplish without specifying how to achieve it. It allows you to declare the desired result.
    
    SQL (for database queries), Prolog
    
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
    
    Organizes code into objects that encapsulate data and behavior. It emphasizes the concept of classes and objects.
    
    Java, C++, Python
    
- **Procedural Programming**
    
    Focuses on procedures or routines that are executed step by step. It is often associated with imperative programming.
    
    C, Pascal
    
- **Event-Driven Programming**
    
    Programs respond to events triggered by the user or the system. Typically used in graphical user interfaces and multimedia applications.
    
    JavaScript (for web development), GUI frameworks
    
- **Logic Programming**
    
    Programs are expressed as a set of logical relationships. It is particularly useful for tasks involving rules and constraints.
    
    Prolog
    
- **Parallel Programming**
    
    Involves the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks to improve performance. It can be applied in various paradigms.
    
    MPI, OpenMP
