## What is Functional Programming ?
Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. In functional programming, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed around as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, and assigned to variables. This paradigm encourages immutability, where once a piece of data is created, it cannot be changed.
