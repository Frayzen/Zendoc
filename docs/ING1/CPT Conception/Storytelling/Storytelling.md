# Overview
Telling stories is a great way to get in touch with people. You need to adapt the story based on the audience.

If you know how to take your audience in a journey that matches their need, youâ€™ll easily convince them.
Storytelling is not a casual conversation. We aim to captivate the audience by surprising, choking them. Anyway, we need to generate emotion and reaction in the audience.
There is 5 steps in building a story:
1. Initial situation
2. Perturbations
3. Incidents
4. Outcome
5. Resolution
