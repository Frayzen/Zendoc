# Why IPv4 is not enough ?
- IPs should be unique to communicate with one another.
- IPv4 is 4 bytes, ie 232 addresses (4 billions). In reality, way less because of:
    - Reserved subnets (non-routable, multicast, etc).
    - Granularity due to subnetting/routing.
    - Hoarding.

# IPv6 to the rescue

- More granularity: switching from classes (/8,/16 or /24), to Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) with any prefix length
- Use of private addresses for personnal computer
- These IPs are not globally unique: they can only be used on a local network, not on the Internet: we need Network Address Translation (NAT) ‚áù more complex routers
