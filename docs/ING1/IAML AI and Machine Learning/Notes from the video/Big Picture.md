- neural networks are just functions
    
    - input all the variables
    - function its elf is all the weights and biases
    - varies (example: vector representing probabilities that an image is classified and we choose the highest)
    
      
    
- its all about minimizing the cost
$\frac{\delta Cost}{\delta w}$
