**Question 3:**  
In a programming language, a class behaves like:
- Correct Answer: A data type
**Question 4:**  
What are the two programming languages that originated the object-oriented paradigm?
- Correct Answers: Smalltalk, Simula
**Question 5:**  
What is a "finalizer" called?
- Correct Answer: A method similar to a destructor but used by garbage collectors
**Question 6:**  
What is called "state convergence"?
- Correct Answer: Two concepts having properties in common
**Question 7:**  
What is the Object Management Group?
- Correct Answer: The American association that maintains the UML language
**Question 8:**  
"Mapping" is a typical abstraction in which programming paradigm?
- Correct Answer: Functional
**Question 9:**  
The term "object-oriented" comes from:
- Correct Answers: The biological concept of cells communicating by messages, Alan Kay
**Question 10:**  
A "private" method is accessible only from:
- Correct Answer: Inside the corresponding class
**Question 11:**  
What is the Turing machine?
- Correct Answer: A virtual machine that can define anything that is computable
**Question 12:**  
What is an "accessor"?
- Correct Answer: The set of methods for reading or writing an attribute
**Question 13:**  
Imperative programming originates from:
- Correct Answers: The functioning of hardware, Von Neumann architecture
**Question 14:**  
What is "single dispatch"?
- Correct Answer: Calling a method through a specific object
**Question 15:**  
What is an "instance attribute"?
- Correct Answer: An attribute having a value per object
# MOD1-2
**Question 1:**  
What is "differential programming" referred to as?
- Correct Answer: Increase rather than restrict the capabilities of subclasses
**Question 2:**  
What are the two forms of diamond inheritance?
- Correct Answer: Duplication or non-duplication of the common class
**Question 3:**  
In the expression "Alex is an employee," what operation is at work?
- Correct Answer: Instantiation
**Question 4:**  
Among the following problems, which ones are related to multiple inheritances?
- Correct Answers: Diamond inheritance, Redundancy of information, Ambiguity in the choice of homonymous methods
**Question 5:**  
What access status is specific to inheritance?
- Correct Answer: Protected
**Question 6:**  
Why do some languages not offer multiple inheritance?
- Correct Answer: Because it leads to ambiguities and performance problems
**Question 7:**  
What characteristics of aggregation disappear with inheritance?
- Correct Answers: There is no longer an intermediate object, It is no longer a set-theoretic relationship
**Question 8:**  
What is "inheritance by restriction" called?
- Correct Answer: Impose stronger constraints in the subclass than in its superclass
**Question 9:**  
The aggregation models a relationship of type:
- Correct Answer: Set / Parts
**Question 10:**  
What is diamond inheritance?
- Correct Answer: Two branches of the inheritance tree that come together to form a graph
**Question 11:**  
What is a protected attribute?
- Correct Answer: An attribute accessible only from its class and its subclasses
**Question 12:**  
In simple aggregation:
- Correct Answer: The aggregated survives its aggregate
**Question 13:**  
Is inheritance a:
- Correct Answer: Transitive
**Question 14:**  
In inheritance:
- Correct Answer: The child class automatically has all the properties of the parent class
**Question 15:**  
What is an abstract class?
- Correct Answer: A non-instantiable class
  
# MOD1-3
**Question 1:**  
What is the Liskov Substitution Principle?
- Correct Answer: The principle of substitutability applied to objects
**Question 2:**  
What is a pure virtual method?
- Correct Answer: It is another name for abstract methods
**Question 3:**  
In C++, what is the purpose of the "using" keyword?
- Correct Answer: To bypass integral masking (default behavior)
**Question 4:**  
What is rewriting?
- Correct Answer: Dynamic rewriting of methods in a subclass
**Question 5:**  
For what reasons is overloading useful?
- Correct Answers: To do slightly different things, To do one thing in different ways
**Question 6:**  
What is called "historical constraint" in the Liskov Substitution Principle?
- Correct Answers: In a subclass, no mutation prohibited by the parent class, Mutation must only occur through an interface
**Question 7:**  
What is an abstract method?
- Correct Answer: A declared but not implemented method
**Question 8:**  
If S is a subtype of T, the substitutability principle indicates that:
- Correct Answer: Any term of type S can be used as a term of type T
**Question 9:**  
What does "covariance" mean?
- Correct Answer: A type linked to a class hierarchy is specialized in the same direction as inheritance
**Question 10:**  
What is masking?
- Correct Answer: Static rewriting of methods in a subclass
**Question 11:**  
What is the main disadvantage of masking?
- Correct Answer: It is resolved statically
**Question 12:**  
What is overloading?
- Correct Answer: The existence of methods with the same name but different signatures in a class
**Question 13:**  
From a typing perspective, a rewritten method must satisfy:
- Correct Answer: Covariance on its return type and contravariance on its arguments
**Question 14:**  
What is the substitutability principle?
- Correct Answer: A definition of the notion of subtyping
