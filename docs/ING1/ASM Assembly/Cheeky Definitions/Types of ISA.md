### R**ISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing):**
- RISC architectures have a simpler and more regular instruction set.
- Instructions in RISC architectures typically perform one simple operation each, making them more straightforward to understand and optimize.
- RISC architectures often have a smaller set of instructions, which can lead to more concise and readable assembly code.
- ==Alpha, ARC, ARM, AVR, MIPS, PA-RISC, PIC, Power Architecture, and SPARC==
==extra:==
- ==RISC architectures are designed to have a smaller, simpler set of instructions, which can make it easier to write and optimize assembly code manually.==
- ==The reduced complexity of instructions in RISC architectures often allows for more straightforward mapping between high-level language constructs and assembly instructions.==
- ==RISC architectures often promote a more regular and predictable structure in the assembly code.==
  
### **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing):**
- CISC architectures, on the other hand, have a larger and more complex instruction set.
- Instructions in CISC architectures can perform more complex operations, but this complexity can make handwritten assembly code more challenging to write and optimize.
- ==Intel x86 CPUs, System/360, VAX, PDP-11, Motorola 68000 family, and AMD.==
==extra:==
- ==CISC architectures, with their larger and more complex instruction sets, can provide more powerful and versatile instructions that perform multiple operations.==
- ==Some argue that CISC architectures, with instructions that perform more complex tasks, might lead to more concise assembly code for certain operations.==
