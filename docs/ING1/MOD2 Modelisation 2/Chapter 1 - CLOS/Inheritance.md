# Reminders
## Aggregation
### Simple
relationship “ensemble / parts”
==eex : football team is an aggregation of football players but each one has a life outside the teamx : football team is an aggregation of football players but each one has a life outside the team==
### Composition / composite aggregation
Stringer aggregation
Parts of the ensemble don’t have a life outside the ensemble
If an ensemble is destroyed so are all its part
==ex : ensemble body, parts : arm, leg, foot… They don’t exist outside==
## Inheritance
Represent an implicit notion of inclusion → include what's above in what’s down
==ex : an employee doesn’t include a human, they are a human but also more than that (an employee)==
  
# Inheritance in CLOS
```Lisp
(defclass employee (human)
	((company :initarg :company :reader company)
	 (salary :initarg :salary :accessor salary)
	 (hiring-year :initarg :hiring-year)))
```
You can give a list of superclass in a specific order from left to right
  
## Characteristics
### Implicit hierarchy
Unique class hierarchy : `user-class` → … → `standard-object` → `t`
`standard-object` : superclass of all object instantiated by the user
It has no slots (equivalent to the Object class in Java)
- ==example==
    
    ==If you create an object of type human it will be an object of type standard-object  
    If you create an employee it will also be a human and a standard-object==
    

> [!important] Don’t mix up
> 
> `standard-object` and `standard-class`  
> `standard-class` : superclass of all classes that you define by `defclass`
### Slots hierarchy
No ambiguity when **multiple** slots have the same name
A slot is unique → the multiple definitions are concatenated → they’re all merged
### Options hierarchy
The modality are different between options (_initargs, reader etc…_)
### Methods hierarchy
If a method can be used on a certain class → can be used on all subclasses of this class
Because subclass <=> subtype
## Instantiation with inheritance
```Lisp
(defun make-employee (name size company salary hiring-year 
											&rest keys &keys birth-year)
	(let ((employee (apply #'make-instance 'employee
													:name name :size size
													:company company :salary salary
													:hiring-year hiring-year
													keys)))
		(incf (slot-value employee 'population))
		employee))
```
Only one entry point : `make-instance`
No chain constructor(_no call to human constructor since… there is no constructor_). All arguments need to be specified.
  
# Problems
## Persistent from classic approach
Don’t mix up inheritance and instantiation (”is a”)
- ==example==
    
    ==alex:Employee → Employee → Human==
    
    ==alex “is a” Employee : its an instance of the class Employee==
    
    ==an Employee “is a” Human : all Employee object are a Human object==
    
      
    
Ambivalence of inheritance : inheritance of static attributes and behavior → all method applicable to a superclass is still applicable to a child class → **inherit interface & implementation**
Equivalence between subclassing and subtyping
## Alternative
### Inheritance by restriction / differential programming
Subclassing to restrain the capacity of subclasses (square is a rectangle where length = width)
We can resolve that (trust: no explanation on this course but true)
### Multiple inheritance / diamond
When a class inherits of 2 superclass that inherit of a unique superclass (platypus: mammal & oviparous)
⇒ merge the definition
