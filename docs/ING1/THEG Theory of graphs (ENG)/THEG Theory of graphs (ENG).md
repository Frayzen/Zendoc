# Grading
1. HW 1 --- Simple Graphs
2. HW 2a --- Eulerian Cycles

5. HW 3b --- Topological Sort'
6. HW 3c --- Graph Traversal
7. HW 4a --- Solving Rubiks Cube

10. HW 6 --- Matchings
Each assignment counts 10% of your grade.  If you submit an assignment before the deadline, and it passes 100% of the tests, you'll receive 100% for that assignment.  If it passes 73% of the tests, you'll receive 73% for that assignment.
If you submit an assignment (seconds,minutes, hours, or days) after the deadline, a penalty (coefficient = 60%) will be applied to the percentage of tests passed.  E.g., if you submit late, passing 75% of the tests, you'll receive 60% of 75% = 45% for the assignment.
Submit as many times as you like, up to 10 per hour. The BEST score per assignment will be used.
