# Figuring out the requiments
### Accessibility
- An easy way to look up shortcuts
- Assign custom button
- Replace terminal usage by UI
    - run, test, git actions, file manipulation
### Assimilate Code
- Easy access to manuals
- An efficient navigation within project
- Show last editor for each line
  
### Production Code
- Button to run a file
- Autocomplete
- Tool included to
    - generate code, tests
    - summarize files, projects, functions
### Open / Close Software
### Motivation issues
- Gamification of the coding process
    - Competitive environment
    - Not stressful
- Create set of actions (avoid repetition)
- Tool for debugging process
- Only load required software
- The session layout should be automatically managed
