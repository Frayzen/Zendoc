### Project Title: Lazy Coder IDE for Motivating Users
### Project Description:
The goal of this project is to develop an IDE specifically designed to motivate "lazy" users by incorporating gamification elements. The base functionality of the IDE is standard, but the focus is on features that encourage continuous coding and productivity through engaging, game-like experiences.
### Features Overview:
1. **Character Profile Image**
2. **Experience Bar and Level Up System**
3. **User Statistics**
4. **Ranking System**
5. **Inactivity Penalties**

### Detailed Specifications:
### 1. Character Profile Image
- **Location**: Bottom left corner of the IDE.
- **Functionality**:
    - The profile image represents the user's progress and motivation level.
    - It starts as a sloth and evolves into faster animals (e.g., sloth -> rabbit -> horse -> cheetah) based on the user's continuous coding activity.
    - Changes in the character are triggered by milestones in the user's activity (e.g., time spent coding, lines of code written).
### 2. Experience Bar and Level Up System
- **Location**: Top of the IDE interface.
- **Functionality**:
    - An experience bar tracks the consecutive time spent coding in a single session.
    - The experience bar fills up as the user continues coding without breaks.
    - Upon filling the experience bar, a "LEVEL UP" event is triggered, displaying fireworks and a congratulatory message.
    - Each level up provides an increasing XP boost to encourage longer coding sessions.
### 3. User Statistics
- **Location**: Top left corner of the IDE.
- **Functionality**:
    - Displays the following real-time statistics:
        - Total time spent coding.
        - Number of characters typed.
        - Number of lines of code written.
        - XP boost level.
    - XP boost increases the more consecutive time the user spends coding, creating an incentive for prolonged focus.
### 4. Ranking System
- **Location**: Bottom right corner of the IDE.
- **Functionality**:
    - Displays the user's rank compared to their coworkers (e.g., 4/15).
    - The ranking is based on productivity metrics such as total time spent coding, lines of code, and XP level.
    - The system only shows the user's position without disclosing detailed information about other users to minimize distractions and competition.
### 5. Inactivity Penalties
- **Functionality**:
    - When the user does not interact with the keyboard or mouse for a predetermined period, the XP boost starts to decrease.
    - Visual and/or auditory alerts notify the user of decreasing XP boost to re-engage them.
    - The character profile image may also regress to slower animals if inactivity persists, providing a visual cue to motivate the user to resume coding.

### Technical Specifications:
### Development Environment
- **Programming Languages**: Preferably using languages that support rapid development of GUI applications (e.g., Python with Tkinter/PyQt, JavaScript with Electron, or Java with JavaFX).
- **Platforms**: Should be cross-platform, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux.
### User Interface (UI)
- **Design**: Intuitive and minimalistic, ensuring that gamification elements enhance productivity without overwhelming the user.
- **Responsiveness**: The UI should be responsive and perform well on a variety of screen sizes and resolutions.
### Data Handling
- **User Data**: Store user statistics and progress locally with an option to sync with a central server for the ranking system.
- **Security**: Ensure all user data is securely stored and transmitted, adhering to best practices in data privacy.
### Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Unit Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit tests for all major functionalities.
- **User Testing**: Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on the motivational aspects and overall usability of the IDE.

### Project Timeline:
1. **Phase 1: Planning and Design** (2 weeks)
    - Finalize feature set and technical specifications.
    - Design UI mockups and user flow diagrams.
2. **Phase 2: Development** (8 weeks)
    - Implement base IDE functionality.
    - Develop gamification features (profile image, experience bar, statistics, ranking system, inactivity penalties).
    - Integrate UI elements and ensure responsiveness.
3. **Phase 3: Testing** (4 weeks)
    - Conduct unit testing and resolve any issues.
    - Perform user testing and iterate based on feedback.
4. **Phase 4: Deployment and Review** (2 weeks)
    - Deploy the IDE for a beta release.
    - Collect user feedback and perform any necessary final adjustments.
5. **Phase 5: Launch** (1 week)
    - Officially launch the IDE.
    - Provide ongoing support and updates as needed.
