# Group Morphism
Let $(G,.)$ and$(H,\star)$ be two groups. We call group morphism between $G$ and $H$ every map
$\varphi : G → H$ satisfying :

The map== ==$Z → Z/2Z$== ==defined by the map "modulo== ==$2$====" is a group morphism from== ==$(Z, +)$== ==to== ==$(Z/2Z, +)$====The map== ==$exp : R → R^*$== ==defines a group morphism from== ==$(R, +)$== ==to== ==$(R^∗, ×)$====.  
The map== ==$det : GL_n(K) → K^∗$== ==sending a matrix on its determinant is a group

## Homomorphism
$f:G\rightarrow H$ between the groups $(G,\cdot )$(H,\star ) \ |\ \forall x,y\in G,\ f(xy)=f(x)\star f(y)$ and $(H,\star ) \ |\ \forall x,y\in G,\ f(xy)=f(x)f(y)$

> [!important] $\forall$
> 
> homomorphism $f:G\rightarrow H, f(e)=e$ and $f(x^{-1})=f(x)^{-1}$
  
# Auto/endo/iso-morphism
A homomorphism $f : G → H$ is called :
- an **endomorphism** if $G = H$
- an **isomorphism** if $f$ is **bijective**
- an **automorphism** if f is both an **endomorphism** and an **isomorphism**.

> [!important] AUTO = ENDO + ISO
  
### Proposition
Let $(G,\cdot )$ be any group and $H$ its set of automorphisms $\Longrightarrow (H,\circ )$ is a group.
# Kernel
Let $\varphi : G → H$ be group morphism between $(G,.)$ and $(H,\star)$. The kernel of $\varphi$ is th subset of $G$ given by :
$Ker(\varphi )=\{ g\in G | \varphi (g)=e_H \}$
# Image
Let $\varphi : G → H$ be group morphism between $(G,.)$ and $(H,\star)$. The image of $\varphi$ is the subset of $H$ given by :
$Im(\varphi )=\{ h \in H\ |\ \exists g \in G, h=\varphi (h)\}$

> [!important] $Ker(\varphi )$
> 
> is a subgroup of $G$ and $Im(\varphi )$ is a subgroup of $H$
  
  
# Orthogonal Endomorphism
The endomorphism $f\in \mathcal{L} (\mathbb{R}^n)$ is said to be orthogonal if for all $x,y\in \mathbb{R}^n$
$\langle f(x),f(y) \rangle = \langle x,y\rangle$
## Properties
- The composition of two orthogonal endomorphisms is still an orthogonal endormorphism.
- The inverse of an orthogonal endormophism is orthogonal.
- The set of orthogonal endomorphisms of $R^n$ endowed with the composition of maps is a subgroup of the group of linear automorphisms of $R^n$.
- An endomorphism $f$ of $R^n$ is orthogonal iff its matrix M in the canonical basis satisfies $M^TM = I_n$.

# Orthogonal matrices Group
We writte $O(n)$ the subgroup of $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ composed of the orthoginal matrices.
  
The orthogonal group $O(2)$ is composed of rotations and orthogonal symmetries.
