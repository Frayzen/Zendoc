# Norms
**Definition**
![[Untitled 1 113.png|Untitled 1 113.png]]
The homogeneity property goes together well with the structure of vector space
A norm induces a distance over E
**The norm of a vector can be viewed as the distance to 0_E**

> [!important] There can be distance but not norm
# Open Ball
**Definition**

It extends the notion of neighbourhood in R
# P-Norms
## Definition
### On a set of value

> [!important] -
> 
> **d_1** is called **Manhattan distance**  
> **- d_2** is called **Euclidean distance**  
> **- d_inf** is called **infinite distance**

## Theorem

> [!important] If E is a vector space of finite dimension, then all norms over E are equivalent.
