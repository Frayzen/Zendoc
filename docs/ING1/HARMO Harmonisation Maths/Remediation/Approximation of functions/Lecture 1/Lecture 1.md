# Up to now
For now, functions f: R → R have been analyzed:
- limit study
- compute derivative
- study of sign of f’
- variations of f
- study remarkable points
  
**Can we replace the study of f by the study of functions we know better ?**
→ sequence of functions
# Functions more or less similar
functions sharing some variations on same interval + same inflection point are called similar
f: x → x²
g: x → 2x²

> point where the SECOND derivative changes its sign
  
## 3 types of approximations
- Linear approximations**Exemple**  
    
$ax+b$
- Polynomial approximation**Exemple**  
    
$ax^2+bx+c$
- Approximation for Taylor Series**Exemple**
$cos(x) = 1 - \frac{x²}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} -...$
**Why approximate functions ?**
⇒ Make it easy to study (_max, min, limits…_)
  
Distance is an applications d : E x E → R+

# Vector space
A vector space has an intern law (+) and extern law (.)
Let E be a vector space and u,v,w belongs to it
Let a,b be scalars.
The **intern law** is an abelien group:
- commutative
- associative
- there exists a unique 0 element
- every element has a symmetric so that u+v = 0
The **extern law** (_multiplication by scalar)_ is:
- associative u(vw) = (uv)w
- valid 1.u = u
- distributive from addition (a+b)u = au+bu
- distributive from intern law (u+v).w = u.w+v.w
## Norm on a vector space
The norm (_written || . ||_ ) is a function from E → [0, +inf[ satisfying:
