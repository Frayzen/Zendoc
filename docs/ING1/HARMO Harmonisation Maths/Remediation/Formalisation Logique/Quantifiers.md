# ∀
We introduce the universal logical quantifier ∀ such that, given a set  
E, ∀x ∈ E means “for all x belonging to the set E”
  
In “∀x ∈ E, P(x).”, we say that P(x) is quantified by ∀x ∈ E.

> [!important] The proposition ∀x ∈ ∅, P(x) is always true, regardless of P
# ∃
We introduce the existential logical quantifier ∃ such that, given a  
set E, ∃x ∈ E means “there exists an x belonging to the set E”.

> As a consequence, ∃x ∈ E ⇐⇒ E ̸= ∅.
