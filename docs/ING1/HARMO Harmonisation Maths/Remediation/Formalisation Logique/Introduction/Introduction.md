# Pattern

> [!important] We might start a proof by the keyword “Let”
## P ⇒ Q
Goal: proof that P implies Q is TRUE

### Exemple
Prove that n in N is evene ⇒ n² is even
Let n in N be an even integer
There exists k in N such that n = 2k
Thus n² = 4k² = 2 * 2k², hence, n² is even
## P ⇒ (Q^R)
Suppose P is true
Split a complex goal into sub goals
**Sub goal 1. Prove P**
**Sub goal 2. Prove R**
