# Definition
Partition of a set  
A (possibly infinite) set of sets P is said to be a partition of E if it verifies  
the following properties:**Non-empty subset**. ∀X ∈ P, X ⊆ E and X ̸= ∅.**Disjointness**. ∀X, Y ∈ P,(X ≠ Y ) ⇒ (X ∩ Y = ∅).**Coverage**. ∀x ∈ E, ∃X ∈ P, x ∈ X.

> [!important] The last two properties yield the conclusion ∀x ∈ E, ∃!X ∈ P, x ∈ X.
