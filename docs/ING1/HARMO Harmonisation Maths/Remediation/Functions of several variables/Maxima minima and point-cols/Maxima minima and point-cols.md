# Extrema
the extrema of f(x,y) is characterized by
$\frac{\delta f}{\delta x} = 0\ and\ \frac{\delta f}{\delta y} = 0$

> **stationary points**

> [!important] * If partial derivate doesnt exist at a point, it is called

The nature of a stationary point is determined by its (_partial_) second derivative at this point
## Arbitrary dimension
In arbitrary dimension, the condition of stationarity is simply given by the relation ∇f = 0
## On the frontier
**_Example_** : we want to minimise/maximise the following function
$f(x, y) = x² + xy + y² − x − y + 1, \forall\ y \leq 0$
The conditions fx = fy = 0 give the point (1/3, 1/3) which is clearly not in the research domain.
In that case we set before hand y = 0, i.e we are at the frontier of the research domain
The condition fx(x, 0) = 0 leads to an extremum located (on the frontier) at the point (1/2, 0).

> [!important] The geometry of a domain frontier may be very complicated ...
## Nature of stationary point
Let the quadratic equation:
$f(x, y) = r x² + 2s xy + ty²$

> [!important] Depending on Monge parameters r, s, t, one can determine the nature of the point (0, 0).
To show this, it suffices to write the function f(x, y) under canonical form or reduced form in function of its parameters.

**Then:**
- r is the second x derivate at point (x0, y0)
- s is the x derivate at point (x0, y0) (_or y x, either one_)
- t is the y derivate at point (x0, y0)
